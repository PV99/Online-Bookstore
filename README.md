![Demo](https://media.giphy.com/media/YkhjgTf2eNGdNisWLb/giphy.gif)

An online bookstore that facilitates product posting and editing as well as adding products to cart, ordering products, and 
reviewing orders. Uses ejs, html, and css for server side rendering. Backend logic, including dynamic routing and crud operations 
are managed through a model view controller framework and express. Three different versions of the application exist, varying in how 
they store and handle data: 1. Data handled through MySql and Sequelize 2. Data handled through MongoDB. 3. Data handled through 
Mongoose and MongoDB.

To run, download Node JS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The download should include a download for npm - a node js package manager.
After having downloaded these, git clone this application's repo and run npm install in command line while in the root directory of the 
application. Finally, run npm start and open up http://localhost:3000/ in a tab on the browser of your choice!
